## Architecture

### Multi-Variant Resume Platform
The site displays the same resume content styled by different AI tools. Each variant runs in an isolated iframe to prevent CSS/JS conflicts.

**Key Components:**
- **Providers System** (`src/lib/providers.ts`): Central registry of AI tool variants with metadata (id, name, path, icon, color)
- **VariantFrame** (`src/lib/components/VariantFrame.svelte`): Manages iframe isolation and PostMessage height communication
- **Data Layer** (`src/lib/data/*.json`): Centralized JSON files served via `/data/*.json` endpoints

### Route Structure
```
/                           # Minimal/canonical resume
/enablement                 # AI enablement content
/with/[tool]               # Tool-specific resume variant
/with/[tool]/enablement    # Tool-specific enablement variant
/data/*.json               # ETag data endpoints (same-origin via Router)
```

### Variant System
Variants are static HTML files in `/static/variants/[tool-name]/` that must:
1. Fetch data from `/data/resume.json` or `/data/enablement.json`
2. Be self-contained with all assets
3. (Optional) Post height updates â€” the app uses fixed-height iframes by default and ignores height messages unless `autosize` is enabled in `VariantFrame`.

Note: When variants are hosted on separate origins and mounted under subpaths via the SST Router (e.g., `/azure/react`, `/gcp/tanstack`), ensure the app is built with that base path and the host is configured to rewrite `/<prefix>/assets/*` â†’ `/assets/*` so asset URLs resolve correctly behind CloudFront.

## Routing Fix Progress (2025-09-05)

- Implemented subpath-safe configs for all external variants:
  - Next.js: `basePath: '/azure/next'` with conditional `output: 'standalone'` (Azure).
  - React (SWA): `vite.base = '/azure/react/'` and `staticwebapp.config.json` with asset rewrite and `forwardingGateway.allowedForwardedHosts`.
  - TanStack: `vite.base = '/gcp/tanstack/'` and Netlify redirects for SPA + assets.
- Hardened deploy scripts to run `npm ci` and fail fast on missing SWA config.

Next steps:
- Deploy each variant (Azure SWA, Azure App Service or Vercel, Netlify/Cloud Run) and verify through CloudFront.
- Run `./scripts/test-routes.sh "https://d2li8p8xclq49l.cloudfront.net"` to confirm headers and 200s.
- If Azure SWA shows host-related redirects, confirm the added `forwardingGateway.allowedForwardedHosts` is active in the deployed config.

### SST Deployment Configuration
- **Domain**: www.austinwallace.ca (CloudFront + ACM certificate)
- **DNS**: External management via GoDaddy
- **Certificate ARN**: `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:737679990662:certificate/061f07dc-2e1e-4751-bfee-e7e26c8b7c80`

## Next.js Variant (Vercel) â€” Production Notes

The Next.js deployment mounted at `/azure/next` is configured for stability behind CloudFront:

- **SSR resume:** `/azure/next/resume` renders serverâ€‘side and hydrates cleanly through CF. This is the canonical resume route for the Next app.
- **Root redirect:** `/azure/next` redirects to `/azure/next/resume` (configured in `variants/nextjs-azure/next.config.mjs`). Keep this for a clean landing.
- **API Proxy:** `/azure/next/api/resume` proxies requests to `https://www.austinwallace.ca/data/resume.json` to avoid WAF/CloudFront blocking Vercel's servers. Both SSR and client-side fetches use this proxy.
- **Logos:** Provider logos are copied into `variants/nextjs-azure/public/logos/*` to avoid 404s when the sidebar renders.

### WAF/CloudFront Issue Resolution
The Next.js variant uses an API proxy pattern to avoid 403 errors when Vercel servers attempt to fetch data from the main site:
- Server-side: `getServerSideProps` fetches from local `/api/resume` route
- Client-side: Fallback also uses `/api/resume` instead of direct external fetch
- API route: Fetches from main site with friendly User-Agent header

### Debug routes (kept, noindex)
- `/azure/next/test` â€” minimal hydration sanity check.
- `/azure/next/probe` â€” prints SSR vs client "fingerprint" diffs to console to catch env/host/basePath mismatches.

Both routes are marked `noindex` and intended for diagnostics. You can remove them or gate with an env flag later.

## React Variant (Azure SWA) â€” Production Notes

- **Base path:** Built with `vite.base = '/azure/react/'` and SWA rewrites for assets.
- **Canonical resume:** `/azure/react/resume` renders the minimal resume. The app router redirects `/azure/react/` â†’ `/azure/react/resume` client-side, and SWA issues a server 308 for `/azure/react` â†’ `/azure/react/resume`.
- **SWA config:** See `variants/react-azure/staticwebapp.config.json` â€” includes:
  - 308 redirect for `/azure/react` â†’ `/azure/react/resume`
  - Asset rewrites `/azure/react/assets/*` â†’ `/assets/*`
  - Forwarded hosts allow-list includes CloudFront and `www.austinwallace.ca`.

## TanStack Variant (Netlify) â€” Production Notes

- **Base path:** Built with `vite.base = '/gcp/tanstack/'`.
- **Canonical resume:** `/gcp/tanstack/resume` renders the minimal resume. Root `/gcp/tanstack` is redirected at Netlify with a 308.
- **Netlify redirects:** See `variants/tanstack-gcp/netlify.toml` â€” includes:
  - 308 redirect for `/gcp/tanstack` â†’ `/gcp/tanstack/resume`
  - SPA rewrites: `/gcp/tanstack/*` â†’ `/index.html` (200)
  - Asset passthroughs for `/gcp/tanstack/assets/*` and `/gcp/tanstack/variants/*`.

## Adding New Variants

1. Create HTML file in `/static/variants/[tool-name]/index.html`
2. Add provider entry to `src/lib/providers.ts`:
   ```typescript
   { id: 'tool-name', name: 'Tool Name', path: '/variants/tool-name/index.html', icon: 'ðŸ”§', color: '#hex' }
   ```
3. Validate with `npm run validate:variants`
4. Test locally with `npm run dev`

## Navigation Context
The layout maintains provider context - clicking "AI Enablement" while viewing Claude Code variant navigates to `/with/claude-code/enablement`, not `/enablement`.

### Variantâ€‘preserving Deploy Navigation
On `/with/*` routes the sidebar defaults to "Deploy Variants". Clicking a deployment entry opens a new tab and deepâ€‘links into the external app using app routes:
- Nonâ€‘minimal: `/<prefix>/with/<tool>[/enablement]`
- Minimal: the deployment app root at `/<prefix>`

## Content Updates
Edit JSON files in `src/lib/data/` â€” the API endpoints `/data/resume.json` and `/data/enablement.json` will reflect changes across all variants.

## Generating Repomix for Context

To create a comprehensive repomix with ~60k tokens for sharing project context:

```bash
# Generate repomix with token count
npx repomix@latest --token-count-encoding cl100k_base

# Or with specific options
npx repomix@latest \
  --token-count-encoding cl100k_base \
  --output repomix-60k.md \
  --style markdown
```

### Current Repomix Configuration
The `repomix.config.json` is configured to:
- Include key source files from main app and deployment variants
- Include configuration files and deployment scripts
- Include all markdown documentation
- Exclude build artifacts, node_modules, and generated files
- Target ~60k tokens for comprehensive context

### Files Included in Repomix
- **Main SvelteKit app**: Routes, layouts, providers, components
- **Deployment variants**: Layout components and key files from Next.js, React, and TanStack
- **Configuration**: SST config, package.json, deployment configs
- **Scripts**: All deployment and sync scripts
- **Documentation**: All .md files including architecture guides

### Token Distribution (typical)
- ~9% - Main app routes and layouts
- ~15% - Deployment variant layouts
- ~10% - Documentation and guides
- ~8% - Configuration files
- ~5% - Deployment scripts
- ~53% - Other source files and components

This creates a complete context snapshot for AI assistants to understand the entire architecture.
