# AI‑Variant Resume Platform

Showcases one set of resume content rendered through multiple AI‑styled UIs, all served under a single domain. The app demonstrates multi‑cloud routing behind CloudFront, strict iframe isolation, and a centralized data layer.

## What This Demonstrates
- Single‑domain, multi‑cloud routing via SST/CloudFront to Vercel, Azure SWA, and Netlify.
- Static AI variants in sandboxed iframes with provider‑aware navigation.
- Centralized JSON data endpoints with ETag for consistency and caching.
- Clean URLs for variant pages using lightweight SSR host routes.

## Live Examples
- Main site: https://www.austinwallace.ca
- Data: https://www.austinwallace.ca/data/resume.json
- Deploy variants: `/azure/next`, `/azure/react`, `/gcp/tanstack`

## Architecture At A Glance
- SvelteKit at the root handles the canonical pages (`/`, `/enablement`) and SSR‑only variant hosts (`/with/<tool>`).
- Each AI variant is a static bundle served from `/variants/<tool>/...` and iframed for isolation.
- SST Router (CloudFront) prefixes route to external framework apps:
  - `/azure/next` → Next.js (Vercel)
  - `/azure/react` → React (Azure SWA)
  - `/gcp/tanstack` → TanStack (Netlify)

## Why It’s Interesting
- Pragmatic SSR where it buys reliability (clean URLs for `/with/*` without edge rewrites).
- Security‑minded defaults (noindex for host pages; sandboxed iframes).
- Operationally simple: static variants are easy to validate, cache, and ship.

## Stack
- App: SvelteKit, TypeScript, Svelte
- Infra: SST (AWS Lambda + CloudFront)
- Variants: Static HTML, Next.js, React, TanStack Router

## Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
